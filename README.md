# Install and Run
These tips will help you install and run the app no matter if you have tried doing that before or you are a complete beginner.

1. You need to have Git and NodeJS installed on your computer.

Git is a source code management tool that will let you download the code that I have prepared for you to your computer.
Proceed to https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git and install it with the Mac or Windows installer

NodeJS is an open source server written in Javascript. It is used for running the app and handling the project dependencies

2. Clone this repository. To do so you need to open the Terminal on your computer and navigate to the folder where you want the code to be. Then you paste this command into the terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/KatGor/code-pub-recipe-app.git`

Your code is now in the new folder called `code-pub-recipe-app`. You should open this folder in the terminal.

3. In the terminal with `code-pub-recipe-app` open run 

`npm install`
Which will install all necessary dependencies and libraries that the project needs in order to run.

4. Head over to https://expo.io/ and create an account there. Download the Expo app from the Apple App Store or from the Play Store.

5. Now you can run the app! In the terminal run `npm start`. If you get a question to install expo-cli, press Y to install it.

6. Once a new tab opens in the browser, click "Publish or republish project". Now the app is available for you in your Expo app on your phone.
